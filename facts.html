                                <p>Frederick County has been a cornerstone of Virginia's agricultural economy for over 250 years. The Shenandoah Valley's fertile soils have supported generations of family farms, contributing significantly to the state's apple, grain, and livestock production.</p>

                                <h3>Current Threats</h3>
                                <p>Large-scale datacenter development is converting prime agricultural land at an unprecedented rate. Once converted, this land is effectively removed from agricultural production permanently, fragmenting rural communities and ecosystems.</p>

                                <p>While datacenters bring tax revenue, they employ relatively few people compared to the agricultural enterprises they replace. A single family farm may employ 5-20 people year-round, while a datacenter might employ 10-50 people for hundreds of acres.</p>

                                <h4>Power Consumption</h4>
                                <p>A typical large datacenter can consume 50-100 megawatts of electricity‚Äîequivalent to the power needs of 40,000-80,000 homes. This massive energy demand strains local electrical infrastructure and increases reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

                                <p>Cooling systems in datacenters consume millions of gallons of water annually. In a region where water resources support both agriculture and municipal needs, this creates competition for a precious resource.</p>

                                <p>Despite claims of carbon neutrality, the construction and operation of datacenters generates significant emissions. The embodied carbon in concrete foundations and steel structures represents decades of environmental impact.</p>
